# Description

This is a Go backend managing gamers' achievements and statistics for an external game.
In order for this backend to easily interface with any external game developped in any language (in a microservice spirit), this backend is built as a RESTful API.

In order to automatically populate the backend and easily test it, a second program called `driver` is made available.
